# Project #5 - push_swap

This project made me sort data on a stack using the lowest possible number of operations.

I had at my disposal a set of integer values as input, 2 stacks and a limited set of instructions to manipulate both stacks:
- swap
- push
- rotate
- reverse rotate

To succeed and get an optimized data sorting, I had to use an algorithm which calculates the operation cost of passing an element from one stack to another.
